# Create-your-own-image-classifier

AI with Python nanodegree final project, In this project we implemented an image classification application. This application will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It will then use the trained model to classify new images.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pillow
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the dataset and training)
